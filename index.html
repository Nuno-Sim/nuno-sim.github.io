                           <h1>Introduction</h1>
                           <p>For my second co-op work term I was re-hired as a Student IT Technician at the University
                              of Guelph's Computing &
                              Communications Services (CCS) department. The duration of this May 2024 - August 2024.
                              This work term report
                              summarizes my experiences during the 4 months aswell as the goals I achieved during the
                              work term</p>

                           <h1>Information about the Employer</h1>
                           <p>During this term I worked for the Computing and Communication Services (CCS) department at
                              the Univeristy of Guelph (UofG). More specifically, I worked for the Managed Desktops (MD)
                              team. This team provides technical support for all computers enrolled in the service
                              including software and hardware issues. </p>
                           <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
                           <li>Managed Desktops manages over 10,000 computers under the UofG Domain</li>
                           <li>University of Guelph is the largest employer in Guelph</li>
                           <li>University of Guelph has seven colleges and three campuses</li>

                           <h1>Job Description</h1>
                           <p>My job as a Student IT Technican was to provide client solutions to all managed devices at
                              the University of Guelph, this could include installing software, fixing and swapping
                              hardware, and providing reliable technological expertise. The most interesting aspect of
                              this job is the people I engaged with on a reoccuring basis. Over this term and my
                              previous one, I have developed a relationship with many individuals at various positions
                              in the University. This exposure has improved my communication skills and has diversified
                              my network. The skills needed for this job were not taught in class as a large portion of
                              the job is simply people skills or solving a very specific problem for a user which
                              involves problem-solving to find a solution.</p>

                           <h1>Goals</h1>

                           <h2>Improved Leadership Skills</h2>
                           <p>During this Co-op term, I aimed to enhance my leadership skills to evaluate if a
                              management role suits my career goals.
                              I took the initiative to guide a new co-op student throughout their work term processes,
                              adopting a managerial mindset.
                              This experience helped me understand the importance of creating a supportive and
                              collaborative environment and gave me
                              more confidence in leading others and clarified my interest in potential future management
                              opportunities.</p>

                           <h2>Written Communication</h2>
                           <p>Another one of my goals this term was to improve my written communication by avoiding
                              slang and instead using more professional words in
                              client interactions. To achieve this, I consistently double-checked emails and messages
                              for grammatical errors before
                              sending them. I've also noticed a significant improvement in my writing, and I no longer
                              make simple grammatical errors.
                              Additionally, this practice has carried over into my day-to-day conversations, where I
                              find myself speaking more
                              professionally overall.</p>

                           <h2>Personal Learning Goal</h2>
                           <p>My last goal this term was to make better use of my free time at work by seeking
                              out ways to assist team members and enhance my skills.
                              I actively sought opportunities to help colleagues who were overwhelmed and took the
                              initiative to complete a co-op
                              guide to help all future co-op's in during their onboarding phase. I now find myself
                              making the most of my time and
                              contributing meaningfully to my team, even during slower periods.</p>

                           <h1>Conclusions</h1>
                           <p>Coming back to Managed Desktops for another 4 months is an experience I am glad I took.
                              This opportunity has opened my eyes to many things about myself from a personal and career
                              perspective. I have come to the realization that I am a very people oriented person and I
                              want to translate that into my future career that will hopefully be in some kind of
                              management position (like project management or product management). I am glad I got to
                              see familiar faces and I am glad they got to see the work ethic I show by offering me the
                              chance to work part-time during my studies. </p>

                           <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
                           <p>I would like to give a special thanks to my supervisors Brian Thomson and Haniya Saleh for
                              re-hiring me and constantly showing me skills that are needed to make great
                              leaders/supervisors. I learned a lot throughout this 4-month work term and I wish them all
                              the
                              best aswell.</p>

                           <h1>Job Description</h1>
                           <p>I was hired as a Student IT Technician which is a very general term for what I did
                              during my work term. To start, advanced technical skills were not needed as I found it was
                              easy to learn on the job.
                              The skills that helped me most in this job were customer services skills to communicate
                              with customers, and time management as often times I was multi-tasking completing multiple
                              things at one time. My day-to-day varied alot ranging from writing documentation,
                              providing technical support, downloading software, and brainstorming ways to make our job
                              more efficent.</p>

                           <h1>Goals</h1>

                           <h2>Oral Communication</h2>
                           <p>Over the past few months, I have completed my goal of improving my oral communication
                              skills. I engaged with clients face-to-face to solve several IT problems. I made it a goal
                              of mine to always explain what I am doing to help them aswell as tips to avoid the problem
                              in the future. I was clear and concise when communicating with clients which earned me a
                              gold star for exceptional service.</p>

                           <h2>Technological Literacy</h2>
                           <p>As this was my first experience working full-time for a larger organization in an office
                              type setting I made it a goal of mine to improve my technological literacy. Especially in
                              Microsoft Office Suite applications, most large companies use some if not all of these
                              applications to streamline their operations. This term I was able to increase my
                              effeciency in various office applications such as Microsoft Excel, Teams, and Word.</p>

                           <h2>Personal Organization</h2>
                           <p>Throughout my 4 month co-op I was able to maintain a healthy work-life balance and
                              maintain productive throughtout the day, even outside of work. This term highlighted the
                              imporantace of hobbies outside of work for me. In the beginnning I found myself bored and
                              unsure what to do after work.. As the term went on and I organized my life a bit more I
                              learned I love to cook!</p>

                           <h1>Conclusions</h1>
                           <p>Overall, I consider this work-term a success from a career perspective aswell as a
                              personal perspecitive. Career-wise I gained my first full-time job experience in the
                              Tech/IT field and it helped me realize that this is the career path for me. I gained both
                              soft and hard skills that will help me in any future endeavorus that I may not have
                              developed if I didn't seek this opportunity. Personally, I met some of the nicest,
                              supporting, and hard working people that I get the luxury to now call my friends. I also
                              learned alot about myself like
                              that in my free time I love to cook and I am secretly a nutrition nerd! </p>

                           <p>I would like to give a special thanks to my supervisors Brian Thomson and Haniya Saleh for
                              giving me this opportunity and trusting in my abilities even when my experience in the IT
                              field was limited. I learned a lot throughout this 4-month work term and I wish them all
                              the
                              best aswell.</p>
